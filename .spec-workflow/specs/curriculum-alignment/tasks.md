## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Infrastructure Setup (Tasks 1-10) → Must complete first
2. Database and Core Services (Tasks 11-20) → Depends on infrastructure
3. Agent Implementation (Tasks 21-35) → Can start after core services
4. Frontend Development (Tasks 36-50) → Can run parallel with agents
5. Integration and Testing (Tasks 51-60) → After agents and frontend
6. Deployment and Documentation (Tasks 61-70) → Final phase

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Frontend (36-50) and Agents (21-35) can be developed simultaneously
- Documentation (64-68) can start during integration phase
- Testing (51-54) can begin as components complete

## Success Criteria

- All 70 tasks marked as completed [x]
- System deployed to production environment
- All tests passing with 80%+ coverage
- Documentation complete and approved
- System meeting all performance metrics
- Cost targets achieved (<$500/month AWS, <$200/month LLM)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: LLM API availability
  - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback models in configuration

- **Risk**: Web scraping blocks
  - **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting and user agent rotation

- **Risk**: Cost overruns
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor costs in real-time with alerts

- **Risk**: PostgreSQL connection limits
  - **Mitigation**: Implement connection pooling early

## Conclusion

This task breakdown provides a clear roadmap for implementing the Multi-Agent Curriculum Alignment System. Each task is atomic, testable, and contributes to the overall system functionality. Following this plan ensures systematic development with proper quality controls at each stage.
