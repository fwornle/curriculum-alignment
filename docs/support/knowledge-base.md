- **Contextual Help:** In-app tooltips and help links to specific knowledge base sections
- **Learning Pathways:** Guided sequences of articles for complex workflows
- **Update Notifications:** Alert users to new articles on topics they've viewed

### 📊 Analytics and Optimization

**Data-Driven Content Strategy:**
```python
# Knowledge Base Analytics Dashboard
class KnowledgeBaseAnalytics:
    def generate_content_insights(self):
        return {
            'top_performing_articles': self.get_highest_rated(),
            'content_gaps': self.identify_missing_content(),
            'update_priorities': self.calculate_update_urgency(),
            'user_journey_analysis': self.map_content_paths(),
            'search_optimization_opportunities': self.analyze_failed_searches(),
            'support_ticket_correlation': self.correlate_with_support_data()
        }
    
    def identify_missing_content(self):
        # Analyze support tickets for topics not covered in KB
        support_topics = self.get_support_ticket_topics()
        kb_topics = self.get_knowledge_base_topics()
        gaps = support_topics - kb_topics
        
        return sorted(gaps, key=lambda x: x.frequency, reverse=True)
    
    def calculate_update_urgency(self):
        # Prioritize content updates based on multiple factors
        articles = self.get_all_articles()
        
        for article in articles:
            urgency_score = (
                article.traffic_weight * 0.3 +
                article.staleness_score * 0.25 +
                article.user_feedback_score * 0.25 +
                article.system_change_impact * 0.2
            )
            article.update_priority = urgency_score
