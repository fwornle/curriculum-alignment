normal reload: [Image #1], hard reload: [Image #2]. And at the same time the local app has changed to this: [Image #3]. Normal reloads on that page reconstruct it the exact same way (incl. the very same errors). Hard reload: [Image #4] - note: you're showing the email instead of my real name. Logging off and on again (on the local page): [Image #5] - now the real name is shown.\
ultrathink, carefully analyze this behavior and fix all mistakes - if you need to check the code, use serena

Perfect! This gives me a clear picture of what's happening. Let me analyze this systematically:

## üîç **Critical Issues Identified:**

### 1. **Deployed version is NOT updated**
- ‚ùå Shows "Version 1.1.0" (old) instead of "Version 1.1.0-prod" (new)
- ‚ùå No "Environment Debug" logs in console
- ‚ùå Still showing old cached content despite "successful" deployment

### 2. **Local authentication showing email instead of name**
- ‚ùå Shows "Frank W√∂rnle" (email) instead of proper first/last name
- ‚ùå This suggests an issue in the Cognito user mapping logic

Let me check the deployment status and the authentication mapping logic:
