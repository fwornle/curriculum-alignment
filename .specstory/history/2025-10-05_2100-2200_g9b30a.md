**User Message:** why is that? aren't trajectory and violations somewhat independent concepts? Maybe it should only show violations when they happen and then right after the compliance score... and the trajectory always concludes this section? Also, should the code not add this file if it is missing? Any new repository will have this issue, unless there is a mechanism that creates this file when it's missing. ultrathink, use serena for code analysis, use claude to fix
