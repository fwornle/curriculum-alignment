so in "2", do you mean repo nano-degree or nano-degree-corporate?

### Assistant

Great question! You need to configure **both repositories**, but for different purposes:

**Repository: `nano-degree` (public repository)**
- **Pages Settings**: Change from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions"
- **Repository Secrets**: Add `CORPORATE_ACCESS_TOKEN` 
- **Purpose**: This is where the GitHub Actions workflow runs and where the site gets deployed from

**Repository: `nano-degree-corporate` (private repository)**  
- **No Pages configuration needed** - this is just the source for corporate content
- **No workflow needed** - it's just a content repository
- **Purpose**: The workflow will access this repository using the token to get corporate content

**Summary:**
- **`nano-degree`**: Configure Pages deployment + add secret + run workflow  
- **`nano-degree-corporate`**: No configuration needed (just content source)

The workflow in `nano-degree` will:
1. Check out the public `nano-degree` repository 
2. Use the token to check out the private `nano-degree-corporate` repository
3. Combine both contents
4. Deploy the combined site to GitHub Pages from the `nano-degree` repository

So the answer is: Configure Pages settings in the **`nano-degree`** repository (the public one where the workflow lives).

Excellent! The changes have been pushed successfully. The GitHub Actions workflow should now be triggered automatically. Here's what will happen:

### Assistant

**The GitHub Actions workflow is now running!** 

Here's what the workflow is doing:

1. **✅ Checking out the public `nano-degree` repository**
2. **✅ Using `CORPORATE_ACCESS_TOKEN` to check out the private `nano-degree-corporate` repository** into `docs-content/corporate-only/`
3. **✅ Verifying corporate content exists** (including `content.encrypted.json`)
4. **✅ Building the site with MkDocs** (combining both public and corporate content)
5. **✅ Deploying to GitHub Pages**

**You can monitor the workflow progress at:**
```
https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/actions
```

The workflow should take about 2-3 minutes to complete. Once it's done:

1. The site will be deployed with the corporate content properly included
2. The `content.encrypted.json` file will be accessible (no more 404 errors)
3. Session 10 navigation will work correctly without duplicates
4. Corporate content will load properly when accessed from BMW network

**What was fixed:**
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow to handle private submodule deployment
- ✅ Fixed duplicate Session 10 links (changed selector to `.bmw-corporate-nav-item`)
- ✅ Added better debugging for corporate content loading
- ✅ Workflow now properly combines public and private content before deployment

The main issue was that GitHub Pages couldn't access the private submodule directly, so we needed a custom workflow to fetch both repositories and build the combined site.

issue [Image #1]

### Assistant

I can see the issue clearly from the GitHub Actions log. The workflow is failing because it's trying to access the private repository using HTTPS with the token, but getting a 403 error:

```
Error: fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano-corporate/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

The issue is that the Personal Access Token either:
1. Doesn't have the correct permissions
2. Isn't a classic token (needs to be a classic PAT, not fine-grained)
3. Doesn't have access to the private repository

Let me update the workflow to fix this issue:

Now I need to provide you with instructions for setting up SSH deploy key instead of using a PAT:

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md",
  "content": "# GitHub Actions Deployment Setup\n\n## Setting up SSH Deploy Key for Private Submodule\n\nThe GitHub Actions workflow needs access to the private corporate repository. Follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair\n\nRun this command locally (no passphrase):\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"github-actions-deploy\" -f ~/.ssh/github-deploy-key -N \"\"\n```\n\nThis creates two files:\n- `~/.ssh/github-deploy-key` (private key)\n- `~/.ssh/github-deploy-key.pub` (public key)\n\n### Step 2: Add Deploy Key to Corporate Repository\n\n1. Go to the **corporate repository**: https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano-corporate\n2. Navigate to: Settings → Deploy keys → Add deploy key\n3. Title: `GitHub Actions Deployment`\n4. Key: Paste contents of `~/.ssh/github-deploy-key.pub`\n5. Check: ✅ **Allow write access** (important!)\n6. Click: Add key\n\n### Step 3: Add Private Key to Public Repository Secrets\n\n1. Go to the **public repository**: https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano\n2. Navigate to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions\n3. Delete old secret: `CORPORATE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (if exists)\n4. Click: New repository secret\n5. Name: `CORPORATE_DEPLOY_KEY`\n6. Secret: Paste contents of `~/.ssh/github-deploy-key` (the private key)\n7. Click: Add secret\n\n### Step 4: Push Updated Workflow\n\nThe workflow has been updated to use SSH authentication. Push the changes:\n\n```bash\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml\ngit commit -m \"fix: use SSH deploy key for private repository access\"\ngit push origin-public main\n```\n\n## Alternative: Using Personal Access Token (if SSH doesn't work)\n\nIf you prefer to use a Personal Access Token instead:\n\n### Creating a Classic PAT\n\n1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens\n2. Click: Generate new token → Generate new token (classic)\n3. Note: `GitHub Actions Corporate Access`\n4. Select scopes:\n   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)\n5. Click: Generate token\n6. Copy the token immediately\n\n### Update Workflow for PAT\n\nIf using PAT, revert the workflow changes:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Checkout corporate submodule\n  uses: actions/checkout@v4\n  with:\n    repository: fwornle/agentic-ai-nano-corporate\n    token: ${{ secrets.CORPORATE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n    path: docs-content/corporate-only\n```\n\nAnd add the token as `CORPORATE_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret instead.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### 403 Error\n- Ensure the deploy key has **write access** enabled\n- For PAT: Ensure it's a **classic** token with `repo` scope\n- Verify the repository name is correct\n\n### 404 Error\n- Check if the user has access to the private repository\n- Verify the repository URL is correct\n\n### SSH Key Issues\n- Ensure no passphrase was set on the SSH key\n- Copy the entire key including `-----BEGIN` and `-----END` lines\n- No extra whitespace or newlines"

**Before pushing, you need to set up the SSH deploy key:**

## Quick Setup Steps:

1. **Generate SSH key** (run locally):
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-deploy" -f ~/.ssh/github-deploy-key -N ""
```

2. **Add public key to corporate repo**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano-corporate/settings/keys
   - Add deploy key with contents of `~/.ssh/github-deploy-key.pub`
   - ✅ **Enable write access**

3. **Add private key to public repo**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/fwornle/agentic-ai-nano/settings/secrets/actions
   - Create secret named `CORPORATE_DEPLOY_KEY`
   - Paste contents of `~/.ssh/github-deploy-key`

4. **Push the fix**:
```bash
git push origin-public main
```

**The issue was:** The Personal Access Token wasn't working with HTTPS authentication (403 error). SSH deploy keys are more reliable for accessing private repositories in GitHub Actions.

Once you've set up the deploy key, the workflow will successfully clone the private corporate repository and include it in the build.
