**User Request:** nice - this is the version I meant: [Image #1] Now, will my next commit deploy this very version to prod on AWS? And will the Version string be V1.1.0-prod? What about the dev stage on AWS... what's that used for? Should my commits not go to dev (version V1.1.0-dev-aws) and there is a mechanism for me to trigger deployment to prod (V1.1.0-prod)? ultrathink

**Tool:** Grep
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": "1\\.1\\.0|version|Version",
  "glob": "frontend/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
  "output_mode": "content",
  "-C": 3
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
