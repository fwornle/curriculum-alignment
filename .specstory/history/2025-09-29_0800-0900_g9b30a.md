soft reload on curriculum.tanfra.com yields the reported errors. Hard reload: [Image #1]

### Assistant

I can see the issue! The soft reload is showing CloudFront access denied (403) errors, and the hard reload is showing an XML error response instead of the React app. This indicates that the CloudFront update I made is pointing to the wrong S3 configuration or the S3 bucket doesn't have the right permissions/content.

Let me check the current state and fix this:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "export AWS_PROFILE=tanfra && aws s3 ls s3://curriculum-alignment-static-staging-930500114053/ | head -10",
  "description": "Check if staging S3 bucket has content"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

### Assistant

The staging bucket is missing the current build content! It only has old files from yesterday. The CloudFront is correctly pointing to the staging bucket, but there's no current build deployed there. Let me deploy the current build to the staging bucket:

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "cd frontend && npm run build",
  "description": "Build current frontend for staging deployment"
}

(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application

- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.

Perfect! I've deployed the current build to the staging bucket and triggered a CloudFront cache invalidation. The issue was that the staging bucket was missing the current build content.

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Root Cause**: When I pointed `curriculum.tanfra.com` to the staging bucket, the staging bucket only had old files from yesterday (Sept 28) instead of the current build with all the fixes.

**Solution Applied**:
1. ✅ **Built current frontend** with all staging/production environment fixes
2. ✅ **Deployed complete build** to staging bucket (`curriculum-alignment-static-staging-930500114053`)
3. ✅ **Uploaded all assets** with proper cache headers and MIME types
4. ✅ **Deployed index.html** with `no-cache` headers  
5. ✅ **Deployed manifest.json** with proper JSON content type
6. ✅ **Triggered CloudFront cache invalidation** (ID: `I6HY9U35SKYCPTLOIAGK4S2TBW`)

## 🎯 **Expected Results** (within 5-10 minutes):

✅ **`curriculum.tanfra.com`** should now show:
- ✅ **Version 1.1.0-staging** (proper environment detection)
- ✅ **Your authentication** working properly
- ✅ **No soft reload errors** (fixed MIME types with asset-specific cache behaviors)
- ✅ **No manifest errors** (fixed icon definitions)
- ✅ **ServiceWorker properly unregistered** for staging environment

The staging environment at `curriculum.tanfra.com` is now properly configured and should work exactly like your local development environment, but with staging-specific branding and environment detection!

Try `curriculum.tanfra.com` again in a few minutes once the CloudFront invalidation completes.
