One thing that's still missing in the classification is a "conversation" notion - if I ask you to make a coding related change then it is likely that the next prompt set is also coding related, as topics often span multiple prompt sets. For this, we would not only need to apply the (up to) 4 layer tests to individual prompt sets, but also to a moving window of the last, say 5 prompt sets (is 5 a good number? should probably be configurable in config/live-logging-config.json). Maybe the current path is also a (weak) indicator about what project the current phase of our conversation is aimed at. Design Layer 0 to provide such a conversation bias. This should also allow you to properly place relatively neutral prompt sets (i. e. without strong indicators either way) - instead of simply placing them in the local project (= default), they would go in the project of the current bias (which could be local or coding).
