**User Request:** avoid DynamoDB - use a performant and free postgreSQL DB instead. Also, better detail the multi-agent system, eg. one web search agent, one browser agent that can retrieve info from TimeEdit and the peer uni's web sites, one document agent to read and write Excel, Word, PDF, one accreditation expert to work on the content of the curricula, one QA agent to ensure consistent format and professional terminology, one semantic search agent, ... and one that coordianates everything - the app should also have a chat feature for me to ask questions about the acquired curricula, gaps, peer unis, etc.
