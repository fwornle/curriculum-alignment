Based on the search results, here are the latest AWS serverless architecture best practices for Lambda and API Gateway in 2025:

## Core Architecture Principles

AWS Lambda combined with API Gateway provides a powerful platform for creating scalable, cost-effective applications without managing servers, and building production-ready serverless applications requires following comprehensive best practices.

AWS offers services that enable creation of serverless multi-tier applications, with API Gateway and Lambda used together to simplify creation of robust multi-tier applications, where API Gateway's integration with Lambda enables user-defined code functions to be initiated directly through HTTPS requests.

## Key Advantages and Benefits

The serverless paradigm offers cost efficiency (pay only for what you use), automatic scaling (handle from few to millions of requests), reduced operational overhead (no server maintenance), and built-in high availability across multiple availability zones.

Both API Gateway and Lambda scale automatically to support exactly the needs of your application regardless of request volume.

## Architecture Patterns

Popular architecture patterns include mobile backends where mobile applications communicate with API Gateway and Lambda, single page applications hosted in Amazon S3 and CloudFront, and general-purpose event-driven web applications that use Lambda with API Gateway for business logic, DynamoDB as database, Amazon Cognito for user management, with static content hosted using Amplify.

In a typical serverless API architecture, API Gateway handles HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate Lambda functions providing REST API endpoints, while Lambda functions contain the application logic triggered by API Gateway and read/write data to DynamoDB.

## Development Best Practices

Key development practices include using the Serverless Framework to improve developer productivity, keeping all infrastructure changes in Serverless Framework generated CloudFormation stack templates, creating different API Gateway stages for each developer, and utilizing Serverless Plugins like Serverless Offline and Serverless DynamoDB Local.

The Serverless Framework makes deployment and configuration management much easier through YAML configuration files.

## Production Considerations

Building production-ready serverless applications requires careful consideration of architecture patterns, security, monitoring, and cost optimization, with success depending on understanding nuances and implementing proper patterns from the start.

Modern approaches emphasize cloud-native patterns, including telemetry and observability with AWS X-Ray and Lambda Powertools, and automating infrastructure with AWS SAM to build production-grade applications.

Best practices include monitoring applications closely, testing thoroughly, and continuously optimizing based on real-world usage patterns.

## Learning Resources

Current training emphasizes mastering AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Step Functions for scalable, cost-effective cloud-native applications, with deep dives into Lambda triggers, context, VPC access, Layers, container packaging, performance optimization, and API Gateway staging, authentication, throttling, documentation, and error handling.

These best practices reflect the latest approaches for 2025, emphasizing production readiness, observability, infrastructure as code, and automated deployment pipelines for serverless architectures.

avoid DynamoDB - use a performant and free postgreSQL DB instead. Also, better detail the multi-agent system, eg. one web search agent, one browser agent that can retrieve info from TimeEdit and the peer uni's web sites, one document agent to read and write Excel, Word, PDF, one accreditation expert to work on the content of the curricula, one QA agent to ensure consistent format and professional terminology, one semantic search agent, ... and one that coordianates everything - the app should also have a chat feature for me to ask questions about the acquired curricula, gaps, peer unis, etc.

### Assistant

I'll update the requirements specification to replace DynamoDB with PostgreSQL and add detailed multi-agent system specifications with a chat interface.

Based on the search results, here's what I found about AWS RDS PostgreSQL serverless Aurora free tier options in 2025:

## Key Findings:

### Aurora Serverless and Free Tier
Aurora does not offer a free tier, while RDS does offer a free tier for the first year of use. This is an important distinction for cost-conscious users or those wanting to test the service.

### RDS Free Tier Changes in 2025
If you signed up for AWS Free Tier prior to July 15, 2025, you can continue to use RDS for free for up to 12 months on select single-AZ instance databases with up to 750 hours per month. If you sign up for AWS Free Tier after July 15, 2025, you can choose between a Free Plan or a Paid Plan for access to RDS. Either plan will offer $100 in credits and up to an additional $100 in credits for activating foundational AWS services.

### RDS Free Tier Details
The RDS free tier includes:
- 750 hours of Amazon RDS Single-AZ db.t3.micro and db.t4g.micro Instances usage running MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL databases each month
- 20 GB of General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage per month
- Free backup storage up to 100% of the total provisioned storage size of your active DB instances for a region

### Aurora Serverless v2 Pricing
For those considering Aurora Serverless v2:
- In us-east-1 (as of January 2024), the price is 12 cents per ACU per hour, with a minimum of 0.5 ACUs costing 6 cents per hour
- If you set minimum capacity to 0.5 ACUs and leave the cluster idle, the best case is roughly $43-45 per month for instance charges
- The cost for Aurora Serverless v2 is $0.12 per ACU-hour, which is double that of v1 at $0.06 per ACU-hour

### PostgreSQL Version Support Timeline
RDS for PostgreSQL 12 reaches end of standard support on February 28, 2025. If deployed in US East (Ohio), you will be charged $0.100 per vCPU-hr between March 1, 2025 to February 28, 2027 for Extended Support.

### Summary
Aurora Serverless (including PostgreSQL-compatible versions) does not have a free tier option in 2025. Standard RDS for PostgreSQL continues to offer free tier benefits for eligible accounts, but the terms are changing after July 15, 2025, moving from traditional free tier hours to a credit-based system for new signups. If you need a serverless PostgreSQL solution, Aurora Serverless v2 would be the option, but expect minimum costs of around $43-45 per month even for minimal usage.

Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of PostgreSQL serverless free tier alternatives to Supabase and Neon in 2025:

## Top Alternatives for 2025

### **Primary Alternatives**

The best Neon alternatives in 2025 are Supabase, AWS Aurora Serverless v2, and Crunchy Bridge. Here are the key options:

### **1. Supabase**
Free Tier: 2 free projects, 500MB database and 1GB file storage, up to 5GB bandwidth, 50,000 monthly active users, and 1-day log retention.(no content)Supabase – Postgres bundled with real-time features, auth, and APIs. Ideal for MVPs and small SaaS apps.

### **2. Neon**
Free Tier: Includes 1 project per user, 10 branches, 3 GiB of data per branch, and shared compute with 1 GB of RAM.(no content)If you want a Postgres database without whistles and bells, Neon is almost the perfect database a developer would desire. It has serverless, branching, auto-scaling.

### **3. AWS Aurora Serverless v2**
Backed by Amazon's 2025 Zero-Cold architecture, Aurora Serverless v2 scales in 0.25 ACU increments from 0 to 400 ACUs with <2-second latency, supports multi-AZ read replicas, and integrates natively with Lambda and Step Functions.

### **4. Crunchy Bridge**
Crunchy Bridge offers FedRAMP-Moderate, SOC 2-Type II, and HIPAA compliance plus 24×7 Postgres Experts on-call, making it ideal for healthcare, finance, and government workloads in 2025.

## **Additional Notable Options**

### **5. Aiven**
Aiven – Enterprise-grade Postgres across multiple clouds with private networking, access controls, and compliance features.(no content)Aiven adds serverless auto-pause/auto-resume in 2025, plus built-in OpenTelemetry metrics streaming.

### **6. Northflank**
Northflank runs tens of thousands of production databases across Postgres, MySQL, and Redis for teams building SaaS apps, internal platforms, and AI services. Unlike platforms that stop at database hosting, Northflank is designed to support your entire stack, from your data layer to your application services.

### **7. Other Options**
- **ElephantSQL**: ElephantSQL is a managed Postgres provider that takes care of the heavy-lifting that occurs under the hood like installation, upgrades to the latest stable version, and backup management.

- **Timescale Cloud**: With 2025's unified tiered storage, Timescale Cloud blends serverless OLTP and time-series analytics.

## **Key Differentiators**

### **Architecture Differences**
Neon is a database service. While Supabase is a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) and Postgres is one of its included service.(no content)Like Supabase, Neon is built on Postgres, but provides several distinct advantages: Serverless architecture: Truly auto-scaling PostgreSQL that scales to zero when not in use · Database branching: Create instant database clones for development, testing, and preview environments

### **2025 Market Context**
The landscape shifted dramatically in May 2025 when Databricks said on Wednesday it would buy database startup Neon in its latest deal valued at about $1 billion. This acquisition validates the serverless PostgreSQL market.

## **Recommendation**
While we've listed several Supabase alternatives, it's worth emphasizing that Supabase itself should still be the first option you consider when starting a new project in 2025. Here's why: It has achieved the strongest community adoption among modern BaaS platforms · It has become the de-facto stack included in most SaaS templates and starter kits · It's natively integrated into AI coding platforms like bolt.new

The choice between these alternatives largely depends on whether you need a pure database solution (Neon) or a comprehensive backend platform (Supabase), along with your specific requirements for compliance, scaling, and enterprise features.
