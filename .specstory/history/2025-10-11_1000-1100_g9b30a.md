### User

proceed with the analysis. ultrathink. use serena to analyze code where needed. Rewrite the test so that it no longer bypasses claude's hooks, but lets claude truly try to detect the constraint violation and react to it. Monitor the real reaction from claude's transcripts and provide real evidence (not just your "reassurances" that you think it works) in the report. Remove outdated reports and no longer used / valid test scripts
