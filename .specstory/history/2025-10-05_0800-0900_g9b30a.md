**User Request:** I just started claude (via bin/coding/bin) and I get this status line:  [GCM✅] [C🟢] [🛡️ 100% ⚙️ IMP] [🧠API✅]                                                                               Thinking off (tab to toggle)
  📋8-9                                                                ✗ Auto-update failed · Try claude doctor or cd ~/.claude/local && npm update 
           --> why is this project (curriculum-alignment --> CA) not listed? And why is the status on IMP although we are not programming anything just now? It seems like the status line does not yet fully take into consideration that there are multiple projects running in parallel and each of them needs their own status, of course. ultrathink, analyze and fix, if necessary

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
