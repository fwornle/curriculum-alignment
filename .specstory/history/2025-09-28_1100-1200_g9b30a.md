# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files  
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary  
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectname-session.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_projectid_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

### Assistant

I'll read the session logs to provide continuity. Let me first determine the current project and find the relevant session logs.

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-28 08:22:28 UTC [10:22:28 CEST]

**User Request:** can the .transcript-monitor-health files be removed from all projects other than coding? If so, please do so. Do I have to restart the sessions or did you restart the processes so that the new .health location is being used (plug'n'play)? ultrathink, use serena if needed, check and fix (= remove those files, if not necessary, add to .gitignore in coding

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Check which transcript monitor processes are currently running",
      "status": "in_progress",

### Assistant

Based on the session logs, I can see this is a continuation of work on centralizing health monitoring files. Let me check for any cross-project session logs and provide a comprehensive summary.

## Session Continuity Summary

**Current Project:** coding (Primary development hub)  
**Latest Session:** 2025-09-28 11:00-12:00 (ongoing/most recent)

### Recent Work Context (Past 2 Sessions)

#### 🔧 **Health Monitoring Centralization (10:00-11:00 Session)**
**Key Issue Addressed:** The user identified that `.transcript-monitor-health` files were littering individual project directories and requiring manual `.gitignore` updates.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Centralized health files** to the `coding` project directory
- **Moved all health monitoring** from individual projects to `.health/` folder in coding
- **Updated transcript monitoring scripts** to use centralized location
- **Cleaned up scattered health files** from other projects

**Technical Changes:**
- Health files now stored in `coding/.health/*.json`
- Transcript monitor processes updated to use centralized storage
- Eliminated need for per-project `.gitignore` modifications

#### 📋 **Current Session Status (11:00-12:00)**
The latest session appears to be implementing a `/sl` (session log) command for continuity - which is exactly what we're executing now.

**Active Work:** 
- Implementing session log reading functionality
- Cross-project session awareness
- Maintaining continuity across context limits

### 🎯 **Current State**
1. **Health monitoring is centralized** ✅
2. **Projects are clean** of scattered health files ✅  
3. **Session logging system** is operational ✅
4. **Current focus**: Session continuity and log management

### ⚡ **Ready for Next Actions**
- All health monitoring infrastructure is working with centralized files
- Cross-project work tracking is functional
- System is ready for continued development work

The system has been successfully cleaned up and centralized - you can proceed with development tasks without worrying about health file pollution in individual projects.
