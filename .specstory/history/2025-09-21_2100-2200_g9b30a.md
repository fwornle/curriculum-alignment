use the spec-workflow to desgin a multi-agent system which can align curricula across the courses of individual university programs of the Central European University (CEU). Each course defines their program in an individual way - accessible through an open web portal (TimeEdit: Courses - TE Study guide). The courses describe content, learning outcomes, curriculum. In addition, each program describes content, learning outcomes curriculum in a central Excel file (or word file). The system shall be able to read from these sources (using a technology like stagehand/mcp to browse the web-site) and other tools (preferable mcp servers) to acquire info from the central Excel/Word file. The application shall have a frontend and backend (frontend: modern vite/react applicatoin with redux pattern state management and MVI architecture. backend: TypeScript with fast vector DB (eg. Qdrant) for semantic searches across and queries to acquired curricula and programs.

use the spec-workflow to desgin a multi-agent system which can align curricula across the courses of individual university programs of the Central European University (CEU). Each course defines their program in an individual way - accessible through an open web portal (TimeEdit: Courses - TE Study guide). The courses describe content, learning outcomes, curriculum. In addition, each program describes content, learning outcomes curriculum in a central Excel file (or word file). The system shall be able to read from these sources (using a technology like stagehand/mcp to browse the web-site) and other tools (preferable mcp servers) to acquire info from the central Excel/Word file. The application shall be able to produce reports (Excel, Word, pdf) highlighting gaps in curricular, outlining aligned curricula in a unified format - all using the same language/terminology. The system shall be able to perform a web search of a configurable set of university with similar programs. The system shall be able to analyze their curricula and compare CEU's curricula with these peer universities, outlining where CEU's program curricula have gaps and where they are similar & same for the courses within these curricula. On a technical side, the application shall have a web-based frontend and a cloud-based backend (frontend: modern vite/react applicatoin with redux pattern state management and MVI architecture. backend: TypeScript with fast vector DB (eg. Qdrant) for semantic searches across and queries to acquired curricula and programs). The app shall be deployed to an AWS cloud room. All IDs, API-keys shall be configurable in private .env files (LLMs, AWS account ID and credentials). There shall be an int an a prod environment. Deployment scripts shall be provided as well as a general install script - once an admin user checks out the curriculum repo, they can simply run ./install.sh (or .bat on windows) to set up the entire system for development and deployment. Regular users of the app simply use the web frontend. There needs to be auth and an administration page on which users's roles and rights can be administered. The app needs to provide up- and download mechanisms for a user to provide program curriculum documents (Excel, Word), configure web links where courses are described (eg. TimeEdit), or download the gap analysis and unified, aligned curricula documents (Excel, Word, pdf).

### Assistant

I'll use the spec-workflow to design this comprehensive multi-agent curriculum alignment system for CEU. Let me start by loading the workflow guide and then creating the specification.

Check if `.spec-workflow/steering/` exists (if yes, read product.md, tech.md, structure.md)\n2. Check for custom template at `.spec-workflow/user-templates/requirements-template.md`\n3. If no custom template, read from `.spec-workflow/templates/requirements-template.md`\n4. Research market/user expectations (if web search available, current year: 2025)\n5. Generate requirements as user stories with EARS criteria6. Create `requirements.md` at `.spec-workflow/specs/{spec-name}/requirements.md`\n7. Request approval using approvals tool with action:'request' (filePath only, never content)\n8. Poll status using approvals with action:'status' until approved/needs-revision (NEVER accept verbal approval)\n9. If needs-revision: update document using comments, create NEW approval, do NOT proceed\n10. Once approved: use approvals with action:'delete' (must succeed) before proceeding\n11. If delete fails: STOP - return to polling\n\n### Phase 2: Design\n**Purpose**: Create technical design addressing all requirements.\n\n**File Operations**:\n- Check for custom template: `.spec-workflow/user-templates/design-template.md`\n- Read template: `.spec-workflow/templates/design-template.md` (if no custom template)\n- Create document: `.spec-workflow/specs/{spec-name}/design.md`\n\n**Tools**:\n- approvals: Manage approval workflow (actions: request, status, delete)\n\n**Process**:\n1. Check for custom template at `.spec-workflow/user-templates/design-template.md`\n2. If no custom template, read from `.spec-workflow/templates/design-template.md`\n3. Analyze codebase for patterns to reuse\n4. Research technology choices (if web search available, current year: 2025)\n5. Generate design with all template sections6. Create `design.md` at `.spec-workflow/specs/{spec-name}/design.md`\n7. Request approval using approvals tool with action:'request'\n8. Poll status using approvals with action:'status' until approved/needs-revision\n9. If needs-revision: update document using comments, create NEW approval, do NOT proceed\n10. Once approved: use approvals with action:'delete' (must succeed) before proceeding\n11. If delete fails: STOP - return to polling\n\n### Phase 3: Tasks\n**Purpose**: Break design into atomic implementation tasks.\n\n**File Operations**:\n- Check for custom template: `.spec-workflow/user-templates/tasks-template.md`\n- Read template: `.spec-workflow/templates/tasks-template.md` (if no custom template)\n- Create document: `.spec-workflow/specs/{spec-name}/tasks.md`\n\n**Tools**:\n- approvals: Manage approval workflow (actions: request, status, delete)\n\n**Process**:\n1. Check for custom template at `.spec-workflow/user-templates/tasks-template.md`\n2. If no custom template, read from `.spec-workflow/templates/tasks-template.md`\n3. Convert design into atomic tasks (1-3 files each)\n4. Include file paths and requirement references\n5. **IMPORTANT**: Generate a _Prompt field for each task with:\n   - Role: specialized developer role for the task\n   - Task: clear description with context references\n   - Restrictions: what not to do, constraints to follow\n   - _Leverage: files/utilities to use\n   - _Requirements: requirements that the task implements\n   - Success: specific completion criteria\n   - Instructions related to setting the task in progress in tasks.md and then marking it as complete when the task is complete.\n   - Start the prompt with \"Implement the task for spec {spec-name}, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task:\"\n6. Create `tasks.md` at `.spec-workflow/specs/{spec-name}/tasks.md`\n7. Request approval using approvals tool with action:'request'\n8. Poll status using approvals with action:'status' until approved/needs-revision\n9. If needs-revision: update document using comments, create NEW approval, do NOT proceed\n10. Once approved: use approvals with action:'delete' (must succeed) before proceeding\n11. If delete fails: STOP - return to polling\n12. After successful cleanup: \"Spec complete. Ready to implement?\"\n\n### Phase 4: Implementation\n**Purpose**: Execute tasks systematically.\n\n**File Operations**:\n- Read specs: `.spec-workflow/specs/{spec-name}/*.md` (if returning to work)\n- Edit tasks.md to update status:\n  - `- [ ]` = Pending task\n  - `- [-]` = In-progress task\n  - `- [x]` = Completed task\n\n**Tools**:\n- spec-status: Check overall progress\n- implement-task prompt: Guide for implementing tasks\n- Direct editing: Mark tasks as in-progress [-] or complete [x] in tasks.md\n\n**Process**:\n1. Check current status with spec-status\n2. Read `tasks.md` to see all tasks\n3. For each task:\n   - Edit tasks.md: Change `[ ]` to `[-]` for the task you're starting\n   - **Read the _Prompt field** for guidance on role, approach, and success criteria\n   - Follow _Leverage fields to use existing code/utilities\n   - Implement the code according to the task description\n   - Test your implementation\n   - Edit tasks.md: Change `[-]` to `[x]` when completed\n4. Continue until all tasks show `[x]`\n\n## Workflow Rules\n\n- Create documents directly at specified file paths\n- Read templates from `.spec-workflow/templates/` directory\n- Follow exact template structures\n- Get explicit user approval between phases (using approvals tool with action:'request')\n- Complete phases in sequence (no skipping)\n- One spec at a time\n- Use kebab-case for spec names\n- Approval requests: provide filePath only, never content\n- BLOCKING: Never proceed if approval delete fails\n- CRITICAL: Must have approved status AND successful cleanup before next phase\n- CRITICAL: Verbal approval is NEVER accepted - dashboard or VS Code extension only\n- NEVER proceed on user saying \"approved\" - check system status only\n- Steering docs are optional - only create when explicitly requested\n\n## File Structure\n```\n.spec-workflow/\n├── templates/           # Auto-populated on server start\n│   ├── requirements-template.md\n│   ├── design-template.md\n│   ├── tasks-template.md\n│   ├── product-template.md\n│   ├── tech-template.md\n│   └── structure-template.md\n├── specs/\n│   └── {spec-name}/\n│       ├── requirements.md\n│       ├── design.md\n│       └── tasks.md\n└── steering/\n    ├── product.md\n    ├── tech.md\n    └── structure.md\n```",

Based on my web search for "curriculum alignment higher education best practices 2025 systems," I found several relevant sources that provide current insights on this topic. Here's a summary of the key findings:

## Curriculum Alignment Best Practices for Higher Education (2025)

### Definition and Importance
Curriculum alignment is the strategic process of ensuring a school or educational institution's curriculum, teaching methods, and resources support key learning outcomes. The goal of curriculum alignment is to enable students to have the best opportunities to learn efficiently and succeed both academically and professionally.

### Core Best Practices for 2025

**1. Regular Curriculum Audits**
Schedule regular curriculum audits, such as annually or semiannually, to identify areas of the curriculum that require updates to align with the latest student learning needs, labor market trends, in-demand skills, and other criteria. During this process, review both predetermined learning objectives and student performance data to spot alignment issues or areas for improvement. Using this information, update learning goals, course content, program offerings, and teaching methods to ensure your curriculum prepares students for successful academic and professional careers.

**2. Systems Alignment Approach**
In short, what is needed is alignment, where the components of the system—curriculum, assessment, and pedagogy—are closely coupled to support student learning.(no content)Implementing instructional coherence requires a strategic approach that ensures curriculum, instruction, and assessment are all aligned to create a unified learning experience.

**3. Industry Partnership and Labor Market Alignment**
Facilitate partnerships between campuses and employers through co-designed programs, advisory boards, and real-world project integration. This includes offering tools that support industry participation in curriculum development and measure employer satisfaction over time.

**4. Technology-Enhanced Curriculum Management**
World-class curriculum management software simplifies educational planning by efficiently organizing class schedules, fostering collaboration among educators, and maintaining a systematic record of student data. Modern Campus Curriculum is a leading curriculum management platform that helps higher education institutions streamline curriculum management.

### Current Challenges and Solutions

**Skills Gap Issues**
The "skills gap" refers to the growing mismatch between what employers need and what graduates are prepared to deliver. As job demands shift faster than curricula evolve, many new hires fall short on the practical, technical, and soft skills today's roles require. Strada Education Foundation reports that 52% of recent four-year college grads are underemployed within a year of graduating.

**Visibility and Communication**
Curriculum alignment is crucial in realizing learning objectives, but in higher education the alignment is often challenged by practical problems. The adverse effect of misalignment is further amplified by the lack of student awareness of their position within the curriculum. We argue for the importance of the visibility of learning trajectories across the curriculum and discuss the implementation of a digital curriculum mapping tool.

### Key Implementation Strategies

**1. Collaborative Approach**
Because one of the top challenges is misalignment and miscommunication, strong collaboration across stakeholders is essential to successful curriculum alignment.(no content)Educators collaborate with other educators and stakeholders to ensure curriculum alignment across disciplines and levels.

**2. Continuous Improvement**
Curriculum alignment is not a one-time fix; it is an ongoing process characterized by regular review and adaptation to changes in industry trends and knowledge. Engaging with employers, industry leaders, and alumni can provide valuable insights that inform the alignment process and ensures graduate success.

**3. Data-Driven Decision Making**
Offer real-time analytics to help institutions identify in-demand skills and align curricula with evolving workforce trends. Provide platforms that make it easy to create, manage, and track stackable, skills-based credentials tailored to industry needs.

These practices represent the current state of curriculum alignment best practices for higher education in 2025, emphasizing systematic approaches, technology integration, industry partnerships, and continuous improvement processes.

Based on my search results, I found several relevant sources about multi-agent systems, curriculum mapping, and academic program alignment for 2025. Here's what I discovered:

## Multi-Agent Systems in Educational Applications (2025)

A recent study shows that generator–critic multi-agent system pipelines can yield high-quality AI literacy materials aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy and usable in classrooms, suggesting that multi-agent systems can boost both scalability and pedagogical quality. However, current multi-agent system designs are not explicitly guided by learning sciences principles.

Research has been conducted using learning objectives from the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), ensuring that generation tasks are grounded in authentic, curriculum-aligned educational goals. These objectives include subject domain, grade level, and standard alignment information, with systems generating learning activities for expert evaluation.

## Current State of Curriculum Mapping in 2025

In 2025, school systems across the US are balancing multiple priorities: digital equity, learning loss recovery, personalized pathways and alignment with college and career readiness goals. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), more than 90% of public schools now use digital tools to support instruction, however, over 40% of educators say they lack visibility into how learning standards are being met across classrooms.

Curriculum mapping is no longer "nice to have" - in 2025, it's described as a non-negotiable pillar of effective education systems, supporting compliance, improving student outcomes, and enabling personalized learning.

## Academic Framework and Alignment Approaches

Online mapping tools have been designed to assist both academic developers and teachers in developing, restructuring and realigning their curriculum, and ultimately to help students become aware of their learning trajectory and re-activate their prior knowledge.

Curriculum mapping processes in higher education are often aligned to assurance of learning (AOL) processes that describe the vertical alignment between institutional learning outcomes (ILOs), course learning outcomes (CLOs) and module learning outcomes (MLOs), usually constructed as part of external accreditation processes.

## Multi-Agent Systems Research and Education

The 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2025) includes tutorials on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, which has been used to train teams of cooperative agents in applications such as video games, robots for warehouses, and autonomous vehicles.

Current research explores how scaling and collaboration across multiple agents might amplify collective intelligence, similar to how collaboration in human society enables remarkable achievements, suggesting that multi-agent systems may offer a promising path forward.

The search results indicate that while multi-agent systems show promise for educational applications, particularly in curriculum design and learning material generation, there's still work needed to integrate these systems with established learning sciences principles and curriculum mapping frameworks.

**User Request:** use the spec-workflow to desgin a multi-agent system which can align curricula across the courses of individual university programs of the Central European University (CEU). Each course defines their program in an individual way - accessible through an open web portal (TimeEdit: Courses - TE Study guide). The courses describe content, learning outcomes, curriculum. In addition, each program describes content, learning outcomes curriculum in a central Excel file (or word file). The system shall be able to read from these sources (using a technology like stagehand/mcp to browse the web-site) and other tools (preferable mcp servers) to acquire info from the central Excel/Word file. The application shall be able to produce reports (Excel, Word, pdf) highlighting gaps in curricular, outlining aligned curricula in a unified format - all using the same language/terminology. The system shall be able to perform a web search of a configurable set of university with similar programs. The system shall be able to analyze their curricula and compare CEU's curricula with these peer universities, outlining where CEU's program curricula have gaps and where they are similar & same for the courses within these curricula. On a technical side, the application shall have a web-based frontend and a cloud-based backend (frontend: modern vite/react applicatoin with redux pattern state management and MVI architecture. backend: TypeScript with fast vector DB (eg. Qdrant) for semantic searches across and <USER_ID_REDACTED> to acquired curricula and programs). The app shall be deployed to an AWS cloud room. All IDs, API-keys shall be configurable in private .env files (LLMs, AWS account ID and credentials). There shall be an int an a prod environment. Deployment scripts shall be provided as well as a general install script - once an admin user checks out the curriculum repo, they can simply run ./install.sh (or .bat on windows) to set up the entire system for development and deployment.

**User Request:** use the spec-workflow to desgin a multi-agent system which can align curricula across the courses of individual university programs of the Central European University (CEU). Each course defines their program in an individual way - accessible through an open web portal (TimeEdit: Courses - TE Study guide). The courses describe content, learning outcomes, curriculum. In addition, each program describes content, learning outcomes curriculum in a central Excel file (or word file). The system shall be able to read from these sources (using a technology like stagehand/mcp to browse the web-site) and other tools (preferable mcp servers) to acquire info from the central Excel/Word file. The application shall be able to produce reports (Excel, Word, pdf) highlighting gaps in curricular, outlining aligned curricula in a unified format - all using the same language/terminology. The system shall be able to perform a web search of a configurable set of university with similar programs. The system shall be able to analyze their curricula and compare CEU's curricula with these peer universities, outlining where CEU's program curricula have gaps and where they are similar & same for the courses within these curricula. On a technical side, the application shall have a web-based frontend and a cloud-based backend (frontend: modern vite/react applicatoin with redux pattern state management and MVI architecture. backend: TypeScript with fast vector DB (eg. Qdrant) for semantic searches across and <USER_ID_REDACTED> to acquired curricula and programs). The app shall be deployed to an AWS cloud room.

**User Request:** use the spec-workflow to desgin a multi-agent system which can align curricula across the courses of individual university programs of the Central European University (CEU). Each course defines their program in an individual way - accessible through an open web portal (TimeEdit: Courses - TE Study guide). The courses describe content, learning outcomes, curriculum. In addition, each program describes content, learning outcomes curriculum in a central Excel file (or word file). The system shall be able to read from these sources (using a technology like stagehand/mcp to browse the web-site) and other tools (preferable mcp servers) to acquire info from the central Excel/Word file. The application shall be able to produce reports (Excel, Word, pdf) highlighting gaps in curricular, outlining aligned curricula in a unified format - all using the same language/terminology. The system shall be able to perform a web search of a configurable set of university with similar programs. The system shall be able to analyze their curricula and compare CEU's curricula with these peer universities, outlining where CEU's program curricula have gaps and where they are similar & same for the courses within these curricula. On a technical side, the application shall have a web-based frontend and a cloud-based backend (frontend: modern vite/react applicatoin with redux pattern state management and MVI architecture. backend: TypeScript with fast vector DB (eg. Qdrant) for semantic searches across and <USER_ID_REDACTED> to acquired curricula and programs). The app shall be deployed to an AWS cloud room. All IDs, API-keys shall be configurable in private .env files (LLMs, AWS account ID and credentials). There shall be an int an a prod environment. Deployment scripts shall be provided as well as a general install script - once an admin user checks out the curriculum repo, they can simply run ./install.sh (or .bat on windows) to set up the entire system for development and deployment.

**User Request:** use the spec-workflow to desgin a multi-agent system which can align curricula across the courses of individual university programs of the Central European University (CEU). Each course defines their program in an individual way - accessible through an open web portal (TimeEdit: Courses - TE Study guide). The courses describe content, learning outcomes, curriculum. In addition, each program describes content, learning outcomes curriculum in a central Excel file (or word file). The system shall be able to read from these sources (using a technology like stagehand/mcp to browse the web-site) and other tools (preferable mcp servers) to acquire info from the central Excel/Word file. The application shall be able to produce reports (Excel, Word, pdf) highlighting gaps in curricular, outlining aligned curricula in a unified format - all using the same language/terminology. The system shall be able to perform a web search of a configurable set of university with similar programs. The system shall be able to analyze their curricula and compare CEU's curricula with these peer universities, outlining where CEU's program curricula have gaps and where they are similar & same for the courses within these curricula. On a technical side, the application shall have a web-based frontend and a cloud-based backend (frontend: modern vite/react applicatoin with redux pattern state management and MVI architecture. backend: TypeScript with fast vector DB (eg. Qdrant) for semantic searches across and <USER_ID_REDACTED> to acquired curricula and programs). The app shall be deployed to an AWS cloud room. All IDs, API-keys shall be configurable in private .env files (LLMs, AWS account ID and credentials). There shall be an int an a prod environment. Deployment scripts shall be provided as well as a general install script - once an admin user checks out the curriculum repo, they can simply run ./install.sh (or .bat on windows) to set up the entire system for development and deployment. Regular users of the app simply use the web frontend. There needs to be auth and an administration page on which users's roles and rights can be administered. The app needs to provide up- and download mechanisms for a user to provide program curriculum documents (Excel, Word), configure web links where courses are described (eg. TimeEdit), or download the gap analysis and unified, aligned curricula documents (Excel, Word, pdf).

**User Request:** use the spec-workflow to desgin a multi-agent system which can align curricula across the courses of individual university programs of the Central European University (CEU). Each course defines their program in an individual way - accessible through an open web portal (TimeEdit: Courses - TE Study guide). The courses describe content, learning outcomes, curriculum. In addition, each program describes content, learning outcomes curriculum in a central Excel file (or word file). The system shall be able to read from these sources (using a technology like stagehand/mcp to browse the web-site) and other tools (preferable mcp servers) to acquire info from the central Excel/Word file. The application shall be able to produce reports (Excel, Word, pdf) highlighting gaps in curricular, outlining aligned curricula in a unified format - all using the same language/terminology. The system shall be able to perform a web search of a configurable set of university with similar programs. The system shall be able to analyze their curricula and compare CEU's curricula with these peer universities, outlining where CEU's program curricula have gaps and where they are similar & same for the courses within these curricula. On a technical side, the application shall have a web-based frontend and a cloud-based backend (frontend: modern vite/react applicatoin with redux pattern state management and MVI architecture. backend: TypeScript with fast vector DB (eg. Qdrant) for semantic searches across and <USER_ID_REDACTED> to acquired curricula and programs). The app shall be deployed to an AWS cloud room. All IDs, API-keys shall be configurable in private .env files (LLMs, AWS account ID and credentials). There shall be an int an a prod environment. Deployment scripts shall be provided as well as a general install script - once an admin user checks out the curriculum repo, they can simply run ./install.sh (or .bat on windows) to set up the entire system for development and deployment. Regular users of the app simply use the web frontend. There needs to be auth and an administration page on which users's roles and rights can be administered. The app needs to provide up- and download mechanisms for a user to provide program curriculum documents (Excel, Word), configure web links where courses are described (eg. TimeEdit), or download the gap analysis and unified, aligned curricula documents (Excel, Word, pdf).
