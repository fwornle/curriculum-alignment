**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production.

     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Bash - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Bash - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected.

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)

     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Bash - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production.

     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Bash - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```

     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred.

     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Bash - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)

     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "cd /tmp/build-artifacts/assets && grep -i \"Environment Debug\" index-B0_-tx8v.js",

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version

   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

### Bash - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript

       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)

     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend

4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \

     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "cd /tmp/build-artifacts/assets && grep -i \"version.*1\\.1\\.0\" index-B0_-tx8v.js",
  "description": "Search for version strings in main JS bundle"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,

       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID

     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process.

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Bash - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID

     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..

### Bash - 2025-09-28 17:31:52 UTC [19:31:52 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers

       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,

       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }

Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the user's explicit requests, my actions, and the technical details.

**Initial Context**: The conversation started with the user running a `/sl` command, which I interpreted as needing session continuity. I read session logs to understand previous work.

**Core Problem Identified**: The user showed screenshots of a deployed application that was broken, showing:
- "Guest User" instead of proper authentication
- Hard-coded sample data like "23 Active Users"
- Version showing "V1.1.0" instead of proper dev/prod versioning
- MIME type errors for JavaScript modules
- Hard reload requirement for the app to work

**User's Explicit Frustration**: The user was very explicit about their frustration, stating they had already fixed these issues before deployment problems occurred. They said: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history and LSL files rather than accepting regression.

**My Investigation Process**: I found recent commits showing authentication fixes, read LSL files, used Serena to understand the code structure, and discovered the authentication code was fully implemented but missing environment variables.

**Environment Variable Fix**: I successfully retrieved Cognito configuration from CloudFormation and updated deployment workflow to inject environment variables during build.

**Final Deployment Issue**: Despite successful deployment with correct environment variables, the deployed app still showed old cached content. I discovered the issue was with CloudFront cache invalidation - the deployment was looking for a distribution in the wrong stack.

**Cache Fix**: I found the correct CloudFront distribution (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered cache invalidation.

**Latest Issue**: In the final exchange, the user provided screenshots showing:
1. The app loads properly at curriculum.tanfra.com showing authentication working
2. But at the direct CloudFront URL (d20c2u6y1wor1h.cloudfront.net), there are MIME type errors and the app requires hard reload
3. The version still shows "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"
4. User name shows email instead of full name

The user's final message was very explicit: "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

**My Current Investigation**: I was investigating the deployed build artifacts to understand why the version detection and environment variables weren't working as expected in production. I found that the debug console.log statements I added should reveal environment variable values in the deployed app.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to fix a deployed application that was showing broken authentication and outdated content, specifically:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" instead of "V1.1.0" in production
   - Fix authentication to show proper user names instead of "Guest User" or email addresses
   - Eliminate the requirement for hard reload to make the app work
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules that prevent normal page loads
   - Ensure the deployed app matches the local development version functionality
   
   The user was explicit about not wanting to accept regression: "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink." They demanded I find previous fixes from git history rather than rebuilding.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with user pools and federated providers
   - React/TypeScript frontend with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
   - Vite build system with environment variable injection
   - AWS Amplify v6 authentication SDK
   - CloudFormation infrastructure as code
   - AWS S3 static website hosting with CloudFront CDN
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific version detection logic
   - MIME type configuration for JavaScript ES modules
   - SPA routing and cache control headers

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `frontend/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx`
     - Contains version detection logic that determines dev vs prod environment
     - Key function `getVersion()` with environment detection:
     ```typescript
     const getVersion = () => {
       const isDev = import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.DEV
       const isLocalhost = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       
       console.log('Environment Debug:', {
         isDev,
         isLocalhost,
         hostname: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : 'unknown',
         cognitoPoolId: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
         mode: import.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.env.MODE
       })
       
       if (isDev || isLocalhost) {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-dev'
       } else {
         return 'Version 1.1.0-prod'
       }
     }
     ```
     - User name display logic: `{user?.name ? \`Welcome back, ${user.name}\` : 'Authentication Required'}`

   - `frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`
     - Contains comprehensive authentication logic with user attribute mapping
     - Function `mapCognitoUserToUser` handles name fallback logic

   - `frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`
     - Complete Cognito service implementation with user attribute fetching
     - Supports federated providers (<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, GitHub, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
     - Modified to inject Cognito environment variables during build:
     ```yaml
     # Get Cognito configuration from CloudFormation
     USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
       --stack-name curriculum-alignment-staging \
       --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' \
       --output text)
     
     # Create .env file for frontend build
     cd frontend
     cat > .env << EOF
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=$USER_POOL_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=$USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
     VITE_COGNITO_REGION=eu-central-1
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=$API_URL
     VITE_API_WS_URL=$WS_URL
     EOF
     ```

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json

   - `deployed-build/` artifacts
     - Downloaded build artifacts to inspect if debug logging and environment variables were properly included
     - Found minified JavaScript files but console.log statements should still be present

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Authentication showing "Guest User"**: 
     - Root cause: Missing Cognito environment variables in deployed build
     - Fix: Modified GitHub Actions workflow to inject environment variables from CloudFormation outputs
     - User feedback: User was frustrated this was a regression from previously working authentication

   - **Version showing "1.1.0" instead of "1.1.0-prod"**:
     - Root cause: Environment detection logic not working in deployed build
     - Investigation: Added debug console.log to verify environment variables in production
     - Status: Still investigating why environment detection fails

   - **CloudFront cache invalidation failure**:
     - Root cause: Deployment script looking for CloudFront distribution in wrong CloudFormation stack
     - Fix: Found correct distribution ID (E2DGUOYHQAA61E) and manually triggered invalidation
     - User feedback: This resolved the cache issue but other problems persist

   - **MIME type errors for JavaScript modules**:
     - Root cause: CloudFront not serving JavaScript files with correct MIME type
     - Status: Not yet resolved, causing "Failed to load module" errors
     - User feedback: "get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'"

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully resolved CloudFront cache invalidation issue by finding the correct distribution ID. Implemented environment variable injection in the build process. Currently investigating why the deployed app still shows incorrect version and requires hard reload despite successful deployment. The core authentication functionality appears to work but user name display needs fixing (showing email instead of full name).

6. All user messages:
   - Initial request showing broken deployed app with screenshots
   - "this is a broken and old version" - expressing frustration with Guest User and hard-coded data
   - "I'm not prepared to accept this step back you are currently throwing at me. ultrathink."
   - "Make sure, you don't just 'restore an old git version', as we spent almost 24 full hours trying to get the deployment fixed. We must not loose this."
   - Request to get Cognito config from CloudFormation
   - "nice - this is the version I meant" when seeing working local version
   - "OK - add this to the README, so it is clear for future developers."
   - "this is what I see on AWS now - it doesn't appear to be the same version as the locally deployed one."
   - "deployment complete, no errors - I see this: [Image #1], login not working... clearly a fallback or wrong version."
   - Final message with three screenshots showing: "online version: [Image #1] (only displayed afer hard reload, normal reload leads to an empty page and errors... just like when I simply click on https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED> [Image #3] - should be my full name and V1.1.0-prod. --> this isn't our current version of the code. ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid "must hard reload". And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix version display to show "V1.1.0-prod" in production environment
   - Fix MIME type errors for JavaScript modules on CloudFront
   - Eliminate hard reload requirement for proper app functionality
   - Fix user name display to show full name instead of email address
   - Investigate why environment variables aren't being properly detected in production build

8. Current Work:
   I was investigating the deployed build artifacts by downloading them with `gh run download 18076710815 --name build-artifacts-2d587f43` and examining the minified JavaScript files to understand why the version detection logic and environment variables weren't working as expected. I added debug console.log statements to the DashboardView component to trace environment variable values in production, but the user's screenshots show the issues persist. I was specifically searching for the debug logging and environment detection code in the deployed build files to verify they were properly included.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request "ultrathink, debug and trace, then fix the issue. Also get rid of this stupid 'must hard reload'. And why are there errors on a normal reload / by just clicking the URL(s)?", the next step should be to:

   1. First check the browser console logs on the deployed site to see the debug output from the environment detection logic
   2. Fix the MIME type issue by checking CloudFront behavior settings or S3 content-type headers for JavaScript files
   3. Investigate why the environment detection logic (`isDev` and `isLocalhost` checks) isn't properly identifying the production environment
   4. Fix the SPA routing issue that requires hard reload by ensuring proper CloudFront error page redirects

   The user was very explicit about wanting these specific issues fixed: version display, hard reload requirement, and MIME type errors..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
