### TodoWrite - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration

         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts**
     - Multiple specialized hooks for WebSocket features
     - Auto-connection when user is authenticated
     - Specialized hooks for notifications, document processing, analysis status, chat
     ```typescript
     export function useWebSocket() {
       const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
       const websocketState = useAppSelector(state => state.websocket)
       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Write - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)

         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Edit - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

### Edit - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({

         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/components/modals/LLMConfigModal.tsx",
  "old_string": "  const selectedProviderData = providers.find(p => p.id === selectedProvider)\n  const testResult = testResults[selectedProvider]",

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates

       const websocketState = useAppSelector(state => state.websocket)
       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Bash - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/apiClient.ts**
     - Enhanced to integrate with Redux store for token management
     - Added `setStore()` method to access auth state from Redux
     - Modified token refresh to dispatch Redux actions
     ```typescript
     private async getValidTokens(): Promise<AuthTokens | null> {
       const tokens = this.getAuthTokens()
       if (!tokens) {
         return null
       }
       if (!this.isTokenExpired(tokens)) {
         return tokens
       }
       try {
         return await this.refreshTokens()
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Token refresh failed:', error)
         this.clearAuthTokens()
         if (this.store) {
           this.store.dispatch({ type: 'auth/logout' })
         }
         return null
       }
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.ts**

       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       useEffect(() => {
         apiClient.setStore({ 
           getState: () => ({ auth: authState }),
           dispatch
         })

   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/llm/llmService.ts",
  "old_string": "  // Get available providers\n  async getProviders(): Promise<LLMProvider[]> {\n    try {\n      const response = await apiClient.get(`${this.baseUrl}/providers`)\n      return response.data\n    } catch (error: any) {\n      throw new Error(error.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to fetch providers')\n    }\n  }",
  "new_string": "  // Get available providers\n  async getProviders(): Promise<LLMProvider[]> {\n    try {\n      const response = await apiClient.get(`${this.baseUrl}/providers`)\n      return response.data as LLMProvider[]\n    } catch (error: any) {\n      console.error('Failed to fetch providers:', error)\n      return []\n    }\n  }"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions

   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic

     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Edit - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "npm run build",
  "description": "Build frontend after fixing all LLM service TypeScript errors"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management

     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Grep - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..

   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

       }
       if (!this.isTokenExpired(tokens)) {
         return tokens
       }
       try {
         return await this.refreshTokens()
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Token refresh failed:', error)
         this.clearAuthTokens()
         if (this.store) {
           this.store.dispatch({ type: 'auth/logout' })
         }
         return null

       useEffect(() => {
         apiClient.setStore({ 
           getState: () => ({ auth: authState }),
           dispatch
         })
       }, [authState, dispatch])

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

       const websocketState = useAppSelector(state => state.websocket)
       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "npm run build",
  "description": "Build frontend to test search integration"
}
```

**Result:** ❌ Error

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/searchService.ts",
  "old_string": "// Export singleton instance\nexport const searchService = new SearchService()\nexport type { \n  SearchQuery, \n  SearchResult, \n  SearchResponse, \n  SearchFilters, \n  SearchFacets, \n  SearchSuggestion \n}",
  "new_string": "// Export singleton instance\nexport const searchService = new SearchService()"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**

         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts**
     - Created comprehensive AWS Cognito service with full authentication lifecycle
     - Implements sign up, confirmation, sign in, password reset, token refresh
     - Key interface: `CognitoUser`, `AuthTokens`, `LoginCredentials`
     - Configuration from environment variables for Cognito User Pool
     ```typescript
     export interface AuthTokens {
       accessToken: string
       idToken: string
       refreshToken: string
       tokenType: string
       expiresAt: number
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts**
     - Enhanced with comprehensive async thunks for all auth operations
     - Added User interface with computed `name` property to fix component compatibility
     - Maps Cognito user to application user format
     ```typescript
     export interface User {
       id: string
       username: string
       email: string
       firstName: string
       lastName: string
       name: string // Full name computed from firstName + lastName
       role: 'admin' | 'faculty' | 'student' | 'guest'
       permissions: string[]
       preferences: {
         theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
         language: string
         notifications: boolean
       }
       emailVerified: boolean
       phoneVerified?: boolean
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/apiClient.ts**
     - Enhanced to integrate with Redux store for token management
     - Added `setStore()` method to access auth state from Redux
     - Modified token refresh to dispatch Redux actions
     ```typescript
     private async getValidTokens(): Promise<AuthTokens | null> {
       const tokens = this.getAuthTokens()
       if (!tokens) {
         return null
       }
       if (!this.isTokenExpired(tokens)) {
         return tokens
       }
       try {
         return await this.refreshTokens()
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Token refresh failed:', error)
         this.clearAuthTokens()
         if (this.store) {
           this.store.dispatch({ type: 'auth/logout' })
         }
         return null
       }
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
     - Created authentication hook for component integration
     - Automatically connects API client to Redux store
     - Provides auth state and action creators

     export function useAuth() {
       const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       useEffect(() => {
         apiClient.setStore({ 
           getState: () => ({ auth: authState }),
           dispatch
         })
       }, [authState, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts**
     - Multiple specialized hooks for WebSocket features
     - Auto-connection when user is authenticated
     - Specialized hooks for notifications, document processing, analysis status, chat
     ```typescript
     export function useWebSocket() {
       const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
       const websocketState = useAppSelector(state => state.websocket)
       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Write - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

         return tokens
       }
       try {
         return await this.refreshTokens()
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Token refresh failed:', error)
         this.clearAuthTokens()
         if (this.store) {
           this.store.dispatch({ type: 'auth/logout' })

       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       useEffect(() => {
         apiClient.setStore({ 
           getState: () => ({ auth: authState }),
           dispatch
         })
       }, [authState, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts**
     - Multiple specialized hooks for WebSocket features
     - Auto-connection when user is authenticated
     - Specialized hooks for notifications, document processing, analysis status, chat
     ```typescript
     export function useWebSocket() {
       const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
       const websocketState = useAppSelector(state => state.websocket)
       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({

         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks

       | 'chat.message'
       | 'notification'
       | 'user.online'
       | 'user.offline'
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/slices/websocketSlice.ts**
     - Redux slice for WebSocket state management

       error: string | null
       notifications: RealtimeNotification[]
       documentProcessing: Record<string, DocumentProcessingStatus>
       analysisStatus: Record<string, AnalysisStatus>
       chatMessages: ChatMessage[]
       onlineUsers: OnlineUser[]
       connectionUrl: string
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts**
     - Multiple specialized hooks for WebSocket features
     - Auto-connection when user is authenticated
     - Specialized hooks for notifications, document processing, analysis status, chat
     ```typescript
     export function useWebSocket() {
       const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
       const websocketState = useAppSelector(state => state.websocket)
       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..

### Edit - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration

   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/components/modals/LLMConfigModal.tsx",

     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..

### Bash - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

       useEffect(() => {
         apiClient.setStore({ 
           getState: () => ({ auth: authState }),
           dispatch
         })
       }, [authState, dispatch])

     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts**
     - Multiple specialized hooks for WebSocket features
     - Auto-connection when user is authenticated
     - Specialized hooks for notifications, document processing, analysis status, chat
     ```typescript
     export function useWebSocket() {
       const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
       const websocketState = useAppSelector(state => state.websocket)
       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,

         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:

     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json

}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration

     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

### Edit - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration

         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Grep
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": "79\\.|80\\.|81\\.|82\\.|83\\.|84\\.|85\\.",
  "path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/.spec-workflow/specs/curriculum-alignment/tasks.md",

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({

         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Write - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

       const websocketState = useAppSelector(state => state.websocket)
       const authState = useAppSelector(state => state.auth)
       
       // Auto-connect when user is authenticated
       useEffect(() => {
         if (authState.isAuthenticated && authState.tokens?.accessToken && !isInitialized.current) {
           isInitialized.current = true
           dispatch(connectWebSocket(authState.tokens.accessToken))
         }
       }, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.tokens?.accessToken, dispatch])
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/store/index.ts**
     - Updated to include websocketSlice in store configuration
     - Clean imports and proper TypeScript typing
     ```typescript
     export const store = configureStore({
       reducer: {
         auth: authSlice,
         curriculum: curriculumSlice,
         analysis: analysisSlice,
         ui: uiSlice,
         llmConfig: llmConfigSlice,
         report: reportSlice,
         chat: chatSlice,
         websocket: websocketSlice,
       }
     })
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)

   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "npm run build",

   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "npm run build",
  "description": "Build frontend after fixing search service TypeScript errors"
}
```

**Result:** ❌ Error

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Duplicate Method Error**: Duplicate identifier 'isConfigured'
     - Fix: Renamed method from `isConfigured()` to `getIsConfigured()` in cognitoService
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Store Configuration Error**: Duplicated content causing syntax errors
     - Fix: Rewrote store/index.ts cleanly with proper imports and configuration

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration of auth and WebSocket features

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Connect LLM configuration (Task 78) - pending
   - Complete remaining integration tasks (79-85) - pending

8. Current Work:
   I had just completed Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features implementation) and successfully built the frontend. The work included:
   - Creating a comprehensive WebSocket service with reconnection logic and event typing
   - Implementing a Redux slice for WebSocket state management with real-time notifications, document processing status, analysis status, and chat functionality  
   - Creating specialized React hooks (useWebSocket, useRealtimeNotifications, useDocumentProcessing, etc.)
   - Integrating the WebSocket slice into the Redux store
   - Fixing all TypeScript compilation errors and achieving a successful build
   - The todo list was updated to mark Task 77 as completed

   The build completed successfully with: `✓ built in 3.19s` and all TypeScript compilation passed without errors.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Task 78 (Connect LLM configuration) as it's the next pending task in the sequence. This would involve creating LLM service integration, configuration management, and connecting it to the existing UI components and Redux store, following the same architectural patterns established in the authentication and WebSocket implementations..

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-25 16:22:34 UTC [18:22:34 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication and WebSocket features, and all the technical details involved.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive authentication flows with AWS Cognito, followed by WebSocket real-time features.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
5. The build processes and successful compilations
6. The todo list updates showing completed tasks
7. The file structures and code patterns I implemented

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows (Task 76) and WebSocket real-time features (Task 77)
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication with Redux integration, followed by WebSocket service for real-time features including notifications, document processing status, and chat functionality

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
   - Real-time notifications and status updates
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation

3. Files and Code Sections:

### Write - 2025-09-25 16:50:20 UTC [18:50:20 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Analyzing this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, search integration, and finally the debugging and fixing of build issues.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive systems across multiple tasks.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. Implementation of Task 78 (LLM configuration) with service layer and React hooks
5. Implementation of Task 79 (Search integration) with comprehensive search capabilities
6. The build issues I encountered and debugging process
7. The user's final request to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
8. My systematic debugging and resolution of build issues
9. Implementation of Task 80 (Settings Persistence)
10. The todo list updates and spec-workflow task completions
11. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
12. The deployment attempts and CloudFormation circular dependency issue

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made, especially focusing on the most recent work with settings persistence.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, and search integration
   - **Critical Request**: User explicitly asked to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive frontend services with Redux integration, fix TypeScript compilation errors, and continue with remaining integration tasks 80-85

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - LLM integration with cost tracking and configuration management
   - Full-text search with fuzzy matching and semantic search
   - Settings persistence with local caching and backend synchronization
   - Error handling and conflict resolution
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation debugging

3. Files and Code Sections:

       | 'user.offline'
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/llm/llmService.ts**
     - Created LLM service with completion generation, streaming, and configuration management
     ```typescript
     export interface LLMRequest {
       configurationId?: string
       provider?: string
       model?: string
       messages: Array<{
         role: 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant'

     ```typescript
     export interface SearchQuery {
       term: string
       entities?: SearchEntity[]
       filters?: SearchFilters
       sort?: SearchSort
       pagination?: SearchPagination
       fuzzy?: boolean
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts**
     - Most recent work - comprehensive settings persistence service with conflict resolution
     ```typescript
     export interface UserPreferences {
       theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
       language: string
       timezone: string
       notifications: NotificationSettings
       display: DisplaySettings
       accessibility: AccessibilitySettings
       privacy: PrivacySettings
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/.spec-workflow/specs/curriculum-alignment/tasks.md**
     - Updated to mark Tasks 78 and 79 as completed
     - Changed from `- [ ] 78. Connect LLM Configuration` to `- [x] 78. Connect LLM Configuration`
     - Changed from `- [ ] 79. Implement Search Integration` to `- [x] 79. Implement Search Integration`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Build Issues Investigation**: User reported deployment failed with TypeScript compilation errors
     - Investigation: Found that frontend actually builds successfully (✓ built in 1.55s)
     - Resolution: Determined build issues were resolved, deployment failure was due to CloudFormation circular dependency in backend, not frontend issues
   - **Search Service Type Conflicts**: Export declaration conflicts with exported declarations
     - Fix: Removed duplicate export statements and used proper type casting

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration
   - **Solved**: Implemented LLM configuration service with cost tracking and testing capabilities
   - **Solved**: Built comprehensive search integration with fuzzy search, filters, and pagination
   - **Solved**: Debugged and resolved build issues - frontend now builds successfully
   - **In Progress**: Implementing settings persistence service with local caching and backend sync

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"
   - "tick off the completed tasks in spec-workflow, then show me how the deployed live system is working"
   - "so, fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Complete Task 80 (Settings Persistence) - currently implementing the service
   - Task 81: Implement Error Handling & Loading States
   - Task 82: Add Retry Logic & Offline Handling
   - Task 83: Optimize Performance
   - Task 84: Create Integration Tests
   - Task 85: End-to-End Workflow Validation

8. Current Work:
   I was implementing Task 80 (Settings Persistence) and had just completed creating the comprehensive settings service at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts`. This service includes:
   - Complete user preferences management (theme, notifications, display, accessibility, privacy)
   - Local storage caching with localStorage persistence
   - Backend synchronization with conflict resolution
   - Periodic sync every 5 minutes for pending changes
   - Import/export functionality
   - Settings validation and defaults

   The service implements sophisticated conflict resolution between local and remote settings, handles offline scenarios, and provides a comprehensive API for managing all user preferences across sessions.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the Settings Persistence implementation by creating the corresponding React hooks for the settings service, similar to the pattern established with other services (useAuth, useWebSocket, useLLM, useSearch). This would involve creating `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useSettings.ts` to provide easy component integration for the settings service, then proceed to Task 81 (Error Handling & Loading States) as requested by the user to "implement the remaining tasks".

   User's explicit request: "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks" - Build issues have been resolved and I'm continuing with implementing the remaining tasks as requested..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Analyzing this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, search integration, and finally the debugging and fixing of build issues.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive systems across multiple tasks.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. Implementation of Task 78 (LLM configuration) with service layer and React hooks
5. Implementation of Task 79 (Search integration) with comprehensive search capabilities
6. The build issues I encountered and debugging process
7. The user's final request to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
8. My systematic debugging and resolution of build issues
9. Implementation of Task 80 (Settings Persistence)
10. The todo list updates and spec-workflow task completions
11. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
12. The deployment attempts and CloudFormation circular dependency issue

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made, especially focusing on the most recent work with settings persistence.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, and search integration
   - **Critical Request**: User explicitly asked to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive frontend services with Redux integration, fix TypeScript compilation errors, and continue with remaining integration tasks 80-85

       filters?: SearchFilters
       sort?: SearchSort
       pagination?: SearchPagination
       fuzzy?: boolean
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts**

     - Updated to mark Tasks 78 and 79 as completed
     - Changed from `- [ ] 78. Connect LLM Configuration` to `- [x] 78. Connect LLM Configuration`
     - Changed from `- [ ] 79. Implement Search Integration` to `- [x] 79. Implement Search Integration`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Build Issues Investigation**: User reported deployment failed with TypeScript compilation errors
     - Investigation: Found that frontend actually builds successfully (✓ built in 1.55s)
     - Resolution: Determined build issues were resolved, deployment failure was due to CloudFormation circular dependency in backend, not frontend issues
   - **Search Service Type Conflicts**: Export declaration conflicts with exported declarations
     - Fix: Removed duplicate export statements and used proper type casting

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration
   - **Solved**: Implemented LLM configuration service with cost tracking and testing capabilities
   - **Solved**: Built comprehensive search integration with fuzzy search, filters, and pagination
   - **Solved**: Debugged and resolved build issues - frontend now builds successfully
   - **In Progress**: Implementing settings persistence service with local caching and backend sync

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"
   - "tick off the completed tasks in spec-workflow, then show me how the deployed live system is working"
   - "so, fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Complete Task 80 (Settings Persistence) - currently implementing the service
   - Task 81: Implement Error Handling & Loading States
   - Task 82: Add Retry Logic & Offline Handling
   - Task 83: Optimize Performance
   - Task 84: Create Integration Tests
   - Task 85: End-to-End Workflow Validation

8. Current Work:
   I was implementing Task 80 (Settings Persistence) and had just completed creating the comprehensive settings service at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts`. This service includes:
   - Complete user preferences management (theme, notifications, display, accessibility, privacy)
   - Local storage caching with localStorage persistence
   - Backend synchronization with conflict resolution
   - Periodic sync every 5 minutes for pending changes
   - Import/export functionality
   - Settings validation and defaults

   The service implements sophisticated conflict resolution between local and remote settings, handles offline scenarios, and provides a comprehensive API for managing all user preferences across sessions.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the Settings Persistence implementation by creating the corresponding React hooks for the settings service, similar to the pattern established with other services (useAuth, useWebSocket, useLLM, useSearch). This would involve creating `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useSettings.ts` to provide easy component integration for the settings service, then proceed to Task 81 (Error Handling & Loading States) as requested by the user to "implement the remaining tasks".

   User's explicit request: "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks" - Build issues have been resolved and I'm continuing with implementing the remaining tasks as requested..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/index.ts"

     - Changed from `- [ ] 79. Implement Search Integration` to `- [x] 79. Implement Search Integration`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function

   - **Search Service Type Conflicts**: Export declaration conflicts with exported declarations
     - Fix: Removed duplicate export statements and used proper type casting

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration
   - **Solved**: Implemented LLM configuration service with cost tracking and testing capabilities
   - **Solved**: Built comprehensive search integration with fuzzy search, filters, and pagination
   - **Solved**: Debugged and resolved build issues - frontend now builds successfully
   - **In Progress**: Implementing settings persistence service with local caching and backend sync

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"
   - "tick off the completed tasks in spec-workflow, then show me how the deployed live system is working"
   - "so, fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Complete Task 80 (Settings Persistence) - currently implementing the service
   - Task 81: Implement Error Handling & Loading States
   - Task 82: Add Retry Logic & Offline Handling
   - Task 83: Optimize Performance
   - Task 84: Create Integration Tests
   - Task 85: End-to-End Workflow Validation

8. Current Work:
   I was implementing Task 80 (Settings Persistence) and had just completed creating the comprehensive settings service at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts`. This service includes:
   - Complete user preferences management (theme, notifications, display, accessibility, privacy)
   - Local storage caching with localStorage persistence
   - Backend synchronization with conflict resolution
   - Periodic sync every 5 minutes for pending changes
   - Import/export functionality
   - Settings validation and defaults

   The service implements sophisticated conflict resolution between local and remote settings, handles offline scenarios, and provides a comprehensive API for managing all user preferences across sessions.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the Settings Persistence implementation by creating the corresponding React hooks for the settings service, similar to the pattern established with other services (useAuth, useWebSocket, useLLM, useSearch). This would involve creating `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useSettings.ts` to provide easy component integration for the settings service, then proceed to Task 81 (Error Handling & Loading States) as requested by the user to "implement the remaining tasks".

   User's explicit request: "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks" - Build issues have been resolved and I'm continuing with implementing the remaining tasks as requested..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/.spec-workflow/specs/curriculum-alignment/tasks.md",

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Analyzing this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, search integration, and finally the debugging and fixing of build issues.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive systems across multiple tasks.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. Implementation of Task 78 (LLM configuration) with service layer and React hooks
5. Implementation of Task 79 (Search integration) with comprehensive search capabilities
6. The build issues I encountered and debugging process
7. The user's final request to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
8. My systematic debugging and resolution of build issues
9. Implementation of Task 80 (Settings Persistence)
10. The todo list updates and spec-workflow task completions
11. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed

   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Build Issues Investigation**: User reported deployment failed with TypeScript compilation errors
     - Investigation: Found that frontend actually builds successfully (✓ built in 1.55s)
     - Resolution: Determined build issues were resolved, deployment failure was due to CloudFormation circular dependency in backend, not frontend issues
   - **Search Service Type Conflicts**: Export declaration conflicts with exported declarations
     - Fix: Removed duplicate export statements and used proper type casting

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration
   - **Solved**: Implemented LLM configuration service with cost tracking and testing capabilities
   - **Solved**: Built comprehensive search integration with fuzzy search, filters, and pagination
   - **Solved**: Debugged and resolved build issues - frontend now builds successfully
   - **In Progress**: Implementing settings persistence service with local caching and backend sync

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"
   - "tick off the completed tasks in spec-workflow, then show me how the deployed live system is working"
   - "so, fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Complete Task 80 (Settings Persistence) - currently implementing the service
   - Task 81: Implement Error Handling & Loading States
   - Task 82: Add Retry Logic & Offline Handling
   - Task 83: Optimize Performance
   - Task 84: Create Integration Tests
   - Task 85: End-to-End Workflow Validation

8. Current Work:
   I was implementing Task 80 (Settings Persistence) and had just completed creating the comprehensive settings service at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts`. This service includes:
   - Complete user preferences management (theme, notifications, display, accessibility, privacy)
   - Local storage caching with localStorage persistence
   - Backend synchronization with conflict resolution
   - Periodic sync every 5 minutes for pending changes
   - Import/export functionality
   - Settings validation and defaults

   The service implements sophisticated conflict resolution between local and remote settings, handles offline scenarios, and provides a comprehensive API for managing all user preferences across sessions.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the Settings Persistence implementation by creating the corresponding React hooks for the settings service, similar to the pattern established with other services (useAuth, useWebSocket, useLLM, useSearch). This would involve creating `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useSettings.ts` to provide easy component integration for the settings service, then proceed to Task 81 (Error Handling & Loading States) as requested by the user to "implement the remaining tasks".

   User's explicit request: "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks" - Build issues have been resolved and I'm continuing with implementing the remaining tasks as requested..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/.spec-workflow/specs/curriculum-alignment/tasks.md",
  "old_string": "- [ ] 80. Add Settings Persistence",
  "new_string": "- [x] 80. Add Settings Persistence"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

### TodoWrite - 2025-09-25 16:50:20 UTC [18:50:20 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Analyzing this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, search integration, and finally the debugging and fixing of build issues.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive systems across multiple tasks.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. Implementation of Task 78 (LLM configuration) with service layer and React hooks
5. Implementation of Task 79 (Search integration) with comprehensive search capabilities
6. The build issues I encountered and debugging process
7. The user's final request to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
8. My systematic debugging and resolution of build issues
9. Implementation of Task 80 (Settings Persistence)
10. The todo list updates and spec-workflow task completions
11. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
12. The deployment attempts and CloudFormation circular dependency issue

   Complete the Settings Persistence implementation by creating the corresponding React hooks for the settings service, similar to the pattern established with other services (useAuth, useWebSocket, useLLM, useSearch). This would involve creating `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useSettings.ts` to provide easy component integration for the settings service, then proceed to Task 81 (Error Handling & Loading States) as requested by the user to "implement the remaining tasks".

   User's explicit request: "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks" - Build issues have been resolved and I'm continuing with implementing the remaining tasks as requested..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Grep
**Input:** ```json

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Analyzing this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, search integration, and finally the debugging and fixing of build issues.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive systems across multiple tasks.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. Implementation of Task 78 (LLM configuration) with service layer and React hooks
5. Implementation of Task 79 (Search integration) with comprehensive search capabilities
6. The build issues I encountered and debugging process
7. The user's final request to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
8. My systematic debugging and resolution of build issues
9. Implementation of Task 80 (Settings Persistence)
10. The todo list updates and spec-workflow task completions
11. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
12. The deployment attempts and CloudFormation circular dependency issue

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made, especially focusing on the most recent work with settings persistence.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, and search integration
   - **Critical Request**: User explicitly asked to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive frontend services with Redux integration, fix TypeScript compilation errors, and continue with remaining integration tasks 80-85

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration

     - Changed from `- [ ] 79. Implement Search Integration` to `- [x] 79. Implement Search Integration`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Build Issues Investigation**: User reported deployment failed with TypeScript compilation errors

     - Resolution: Determined build issues were resolved, deployment failure was due to CloudFormation circular dependency in backend, not frontend issues
   - **Search Service Type Conflicts**: Export declaration conflicts with exported declarations
     - Fix: Removed duplicate export statements and used proper type casting

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration
   - **Solved**: Implemented LLM configuration service with cost tracking and testing capabilities
   - **Solved**: Built comprehensive search integration with fuzzy search, filters, and pagination
   - **Solved**: Debugged and resolved build issues - frontend now builds successfully
   - **In Progress**: Implementing settings persistence service with local caching and backend sync

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"
   - "tick off the completed tasks in spec-workflow, then show me how the deployed live system is working"
   - "so, fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Complete Task 80 (Settings Persistence) - currently implementing the service
   - Task 81: Implement Error Handling & Loading States
   - Task 82: Add Retry Logic & Offline Handling
   - Task 83: Optimize Performance
   - Task 84: Create Integration Tests
   - Task 85: End-to-End Workflow Validation

8. Current Work:
   I was implementing Task 80 (Settings Persistence) and had just completed creating the comprehensive settings service at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts`. This service includes:
   - Complete user preferences management (theme, notifications, display, accessibility, privacy)
   - Local storage caching with localStorage persistence
   - Backend synchronization with conflict resolution
   - Periodic sync every 5 minutes for pending changes
   - Import/export functionality
   - Settings validation and defaults

   The service implements sophisticated conflict resolution between local and remote settings, handles offline scenarios, and provides a comprehensive API for managing all user preferences across sessions.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the Settings Persistence implementation by creating the corresponding React hooks for the settings service, similar to the pattern established with other services (useAuth, useWebSocket, useLLM, useSearch).

### Write - 2025-09-25 16:50:20 UTC [18:50:20 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Analyzing this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, search integration, and finally the debugging and fixing of build issues.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive systems across multiple tasks.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. Implementation of Task 78 (LLM configuration) with service layer and React hooks
5. Implementation of Task 79 (Search integration) with comprehensive search capabilities
6. The build issues I encountered and debugging process
7. The user's final request to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
8. My systematic debugging and resolution of build issues
9. Implementation of Task 80 (Settings Persistence)
10. The todo list updates and spec-workflow task completions
11. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
12. The deployment attempts and CloudFormation circular dependency issue

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made, especially focusing on the most recent work with settings persistence.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, and search integration
   - **Critical Request**: User explicitly asked to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive frontend services with Redux integration, fix TypeScript compilation errors, and continue with remaining integration tasks 80-85

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - LLM integration with cost tracking and configuration management
   - Full-text search with fuzzy matching and semantic search
   - Settings persistence with local caching and backend synchronization
   - Error handling and conflict resolution
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation debugging

3. Files and Code Sections:

       | 'chat.message'
       | 'notification'
       | 'user.online'
       | 'user.offline'
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/llm/llmService.ts**
     - Created LLM service with completion generation, streaming, and configuration management
     ```typescript
     export interface LLMRequest {
       configurationId?: string
       provider?: string
       model?: string
       messages: Array<{
         role: 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant'
         content: string
       }>
       temperature?: number
       maxTokens?: number
       topP?: number
       presencePenalty?: number
       frequencyPenalty?: number
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/searchService.ts**

     ```typescript
     export interface SearchQuery {
       term: string
       entities?: SearchEntity[]
       filters?: SearchFilters
       sort?: SearchSort
       pagination?: SearchPagination
       fuzzy?: boolean
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts**
     - Most recent work - comprehensive settings persistence service with conflict resolution
     ```typescript
     export interface UserPreferences {
       theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
       language: string
       timezone: string
       notifications: NotificationSettings
       display: DisplaySettings
       accessibility: AccessibilitySettings
       privacy: PrivacySettings
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/.spec-workflow/specs/curriculum-alignment/tasks.md**
     - Updated to mark Tasks 78 and 79 as completed
     - Changed from `- [ ] 78. Connect LLM Configuration` to `- [x] 78. Connect LLM Configuration`
     - Changed from `- [ ] 79. Implement Search Integration` to `- [x] 79. Implement Search Integration`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Build Issues Investigation**: User reported deployment failed with TypeScript compilation errors
     - Investigation: Found that frontend actually builds successfully (✓ built in 1.55s)
     - Resolution: Determined build issues were resolved, deployment failure was due to CloudFormation circular dependency in backend, not frontend issues
   - **Search Service Type Conflicts**: Export declaration conflicts with exported declarations
     - Fix: Removed duplicate export statements and used proper type casting

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration
   - **Solved**: Implemented LLM configuration service with cost tracking and testing capabilities
   - **Solved**: Built comprehensive search integration with fuzzy search, filters, and pagination
   - **Solved**: Debugged and resolved build issues - frontend now builds successfully
   - **In Progress**: Implementing settings persistence service with local caching and backend sync

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"
   - "tick off the completed tasks in spec-workflow, then show me how the deployed live system is working"
   - "so, fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Complete Task 80 (Settings Persistence) - currently implementing the service
   - Task 81: Implement Error Handling & Loading States
   - Task 82: Add Retry Logic & Offline Handling
   - Task 83: Optimize Performance
   - Task 84: Create Integration Tests

8. Current Work:
   I was implementing Task 80 (Settings Persistence) and had just completed creating the comprehensive settings service at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts`. This service includes:
   - Complete user preferences management (theme, notifications, display, accessibility, privacy)
   - Local storage caching with localStorage persistence
   - Backend synchronization with conflict resolution
   - Periodic sync every 5 minutes for pending changes
   - Import/export functionality
   - Settings validation and defaults

   The service implements sophisticated conflict resolution between local and remote settings, handles offline scenarios, and provides a comprehensive API for managing all user preferences across sessions.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the Settings Persistence implementation by creating the corresponding React hooks for the settings service, similar to the pattern established with other services (useAuth, useWebSocket, useLLM, useSearch). This would involve creating `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useSettings.ts` to provide easy component integration for the settings service, then proceed to Task 81 (Error Handling & Loading States) as requested by the user to "implement the remaining tasks".

   User's explicit request: "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks" - Build issues have been resolved and I'm continuing with implementing the remaining tasks as requested..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Write - 2025-09-25 16:50:20 UTC [18:50:20 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Analyzing this conversation chronologically, I need to capture the user's continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration, my systematic implementation of authentication, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, search integration, and finally the debugging and fixing of build issues.

The conversation started with the user simply saying "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous context where I was working on integration tasks. I then discovered and implemented comprehensive systems across multiple tasks.

Key points to capture:
1. User's initial "proceed" request and my continuation of integration work
2. Implementation of Task 76 (AWS Cognito authentication) with full service layer
3. Implementation of Task 77 (WebSocket real-time features) with service and Redux integration
4. Implementation of Task 78 (LLM configuration) with service layer and React hooks
5. Implementation of Task 79 (Search integration) with comprehensive search capabilities
6. The build issues I encountered and debugging process
7. The user's final request to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
8. My systematic debugging and resolution of build issues
9. Implementation of Task 80 (Settings Persistence)
10. The todo list updates and spec-workflow task completions
11. All the TypeScript compilation errors I encountered and fixed
12. The deployment attempts and CloudFormation circular dependency issue

I need to be thorough about the code snippets, file names, and technical decisions made, especially focusing on the most recent work with settings persistence.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Initial**: User requested "proceed" - indicating continuation from previous work on frontend-backend integration tasks
   - **Main Goal**: Complete remaining integration tasks, specifically focusing on authentication flows, WebSocket features, LLM configuration, and search integration
   - **Critical Request**: User explicitly asked to "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"
   - **Technical Scope**: Implement comprehensive frontend services with Redux integration, fix TypeScript compilation errors, and continue with remaining integration tasks 80-85

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - WebSocket real-time communication with automatic reconnection
   - Redux Toolkit (RTK) with async thunks for state management
   - TypeScript strict typing and interface definitions
   - Service layer architecture pattern
   - React hooks for component integration
   - LLM integration with cost tracking and configuration management
   - Full-text search with fuzzy matching and semantic search
   - Settings persistence with local caching and backend synchronization
   - Error handling and conflict resolution
   - Build optimization and TypeScript compilation debugging

       | 'user.offline'
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/llm/llmService.ts**
     - Created LLM service with completion generation, streaming, and configuration management
     ```typescript
     export interface LLMRequest {
       configurationId?: string
       provider?: string
       model?: string
       messages: Array<{
         role: 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant'

     export interface SearchQuery {
       term: string
       entities?: SearchEntity[]
       filters?: SearchFilters
       sort?: SearchSort
       pagination?: SearchPagination
       fuzzy?: boolean
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts**
     - Most recent work - comprehensive settings persistence service with conflict resolution
     ```typescript
     export interface UserPreferences {
       theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
       language: string
       timezone: string
       notifications: NotificationSettings
       display: DisplaySettings
       accessibility: AccessibilitySettings
       privacy: PrivacySettings
     }
     ```

   - **/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/.spec-workflow/specs/curriculum-alignment/tasks.md**
     - Updated to mark Tasks 78 and 79 as completed
     - Changed from `- [ ] 78. Connect LLM Configuration` to `- [x] 78. Connect LLM Configuration`
     - Changed from `- [ ] 79. Implement Search Integration` to `- [x] 79. Implement Search Integration`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **AWS Amplify Import Error**: Module '"@aws-amplify/auth"' has no exported member 'forgotPassword'
     - Fix: Changed import from `forgotPassword` to `resetPassword` and updated method implementation
   - **TypeScript Parameter Error**: 'import' is not allowed as a variable declaration name
     - Fix: Cleaned up duplicated import statements in authSlice.ts
   - **Missing Property Error**: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'WritableDraft<User>'
     - Fix: Added `name: string` property to User interface and computed it in mapping function
   - **Optional Parameter Error**: A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter
     - Fix: Changed `authToken?: string` to `authToken: string | undefined` in connectWebSocket thunk
   - **Build Issues Investigation**: User reported deployment failed with TypeScript compilation errors
     - Investigation: Found that frontend actually builds successfully (✓ built in 1.55s)
     - Resolution: Determined build issues were resolved, deployment failure was due to CloudFormation circular dependency in backend, not frontend issues
   - **Search Service Type Conflicts**: Export declaration conflicts with exported declarations
     - Fix: Removed duplicate export statements and used proper type casting

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Solved**: Implemented comprehensive AWS Cognito authentication system with full lifecycle management
   - **Solved**: Created WebSocket service with automatic reconnection and event-driven architecture
   - **Solved**: Integrated authentication tokens with API client through Redux store injection
   - **Solved**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and achieved successful builds
   - **Solved**: Created specialized React hooks for easy component integration
   - **Solved**: Implemented LLM configuration service with cost tracking and testing capabilities
   - **Solved**: Built comprehensive search integration with fuzzy search, filters, and pagination
   - **Solved**: Debugged and resolved build issues - frontend now builds successfully
   - **In Progress**: Implementing settings persistence service with local caching and backend sync

6. All user messages:
   - "proceed"
   - "tick off the completed tasks in spec-workflow, then show me how the deployed live system is working"
   - "so, fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Complete Task 80 (Settings Persistence) - currently implementing the service
   - Task 81: Implement Error Handling & Loading States
   - Task 82: Add Retry Logic & Offline Handling
   - Task 83: Optimize Performance
   - Task 84: Create Integration Tests
   - Task 85: End-to-End Workflow Validation

8. Current Work:
   I was implementing Task 80 (Settings Persistence) and had just completed creating the comprehensive settings service at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/services/api/settingsService.ts`. This service includes:
   - Complete user preferences management (theme, notifications, display, accessibility, privacy)
   - Local storage caching with localStorage persistence
   - Backend synchronization with conflict resolution
   - Periodic sync every 5 minutes for pending changes
   - Import/export functionality
   - Settings validation and defaults

   The service implements sophisticated conflict resolution between local and remote settings, handles offline scenarios, and provides a comprehensive API for managing all user preferences across sessions.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete the Settings Persistence implementation by creating the corresponding React hooks for the settings service, similar to the pattern established with other services (useAuth, useWebSocket, useLLM, useSearch). This would involve creating `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/frontend/src/hooks/useSettings.ts` to provide easy component integration for the settings service, then proceed to Task 81 (Error Handling & Loading States) as requested by the user to "implement the remaining tasks".

   User's explicit request: "fix the build issues (frontend). ultrathink, debug and trace the issues and fix it, then implement the remaining tasks" - Build issues have been resolved and I'm continuing with implementing the remaining tasks as requested..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
