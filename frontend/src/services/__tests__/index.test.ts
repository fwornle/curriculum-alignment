/**
 * Integration Test Suite Overview
 * 
 * This file serves as the entry point for all service layer integration tests.
 * The cache.test.ts file demonstrates the comprehensive testing approach used
 * throughout the service layer.
 * 
 * Test Coverage Strategy:
 * - Each service has comprehensive unit and integration tests
 * - Mock API responses for predictable testing
 * - Test error cases and edge conditions
 * - Validate state updates and side effects
 * - Ensure proper cleanup and resource management
 * 
 * Services Tested:
 * ✅ Cache Service - Complete integration tests (cache.test.ts)
 * 📝 Error Handler - Error handling and toast notifications
 * 📝 Retry Queue - Queue operations and retry logic  
 * 📝 Offline Manager - Network detection and sync
 * 📝 Settings Service - Persistence and sync
 * 📝 Auth Service - Cognito integration
 * 📝 WebSocket Service - Real-time communication
 * 📝 LLM Service - AI integration and configuration
 * 📝 Search Service - Search functionality
 * 
 * Test Environment Setup:
 * - Jest for test framework
 * - MSW for API mocking  
 * - React Testing Library for component integration
 * - Custom test utilities for service layer
